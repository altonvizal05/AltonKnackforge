        <p>
        Hi, I'm Alton Vizal Raj, a passionate and driven Mechanical Engineering graduate from Panimalar Engineering College with a CGPA of 8.4. Although my academic background is in engineering, my true interest lies in the field of software development. Over the years, I’ve developed strong skills in Core Java, SQL, J2EE, Hibernate, HTML, and CSS. I’m also familiar with tools like Eclipse, VS Code, and SQL Server Management Studio, and I enjoy working with Agile methodologies.
        
        What sets me apart is my curiosity and eagerness to learn. I'm always exploring new technologies and enjoy solving complex problems through logical thinking and analytical skills. I believe in continuous improvement and strive to stay updated with the latest trends in tech. Whether it's coding, collaborating in teams, or managing time effectively, I’m committed to delivering quality and innovation in whatever I do.
